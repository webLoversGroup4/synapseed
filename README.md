## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Vite + React
- **Backend:** PHP serving APIs

## Project Structure and Architecture

One notable issue encountered during development was the absence of an `index.html` file in every folder, which prevented the successful build of the entire project into a `dist` folder. This impacted website performance due to slower page reloads.
